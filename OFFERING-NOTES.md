Dignity Gold Offering and Structural Notes
Version 1.0

Purpose of This Document

This document is provided as contextual reference regarding the structural and funding considerations of the Dignity Gold initiative. It is intended to clarify how capital formation has been approached historically and how future funding may be structured. This document does not constitute an offer, solicitation, or recommendation of any securities or digital assets.

General Funding Approach

Dignity Gold has been developed through a combination of founder capital contributions and strategic private participation. The project has not conducted, and does not currently contemplate, a public token offering. Capital formation activities are designed to be selective, jurisdiction-aware, and aligned with long-term operational objectives.

Any future capital raises are expected to occur through private placements or strategic arrangements with qualified participants, subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Such activities are conducted independently of secondary market trading activity and are not intended to influence or support market pricing.

Relationship Between Tokens and Funding

DIGau is a digital asset associated with participation in the Dignity ecosystem. The existence or transfer of DIGau tokens should not be interpreted as representing equity ownership, profit-sharing rights, or entitlement to dividends. Tokens are not issued as investment contracts and do not convey governance rights beyond those expressly defined by internal project frameworks.

Where tokens are issued in connection with private funding arrangements, such issuances are subject to contractual terms, transfer restrictions, and compliance obligations specific to the participating parties. These arrangements are not standardized and are not made available to the general public.

Use of Proceeds Considerations

Capital raised through private arrangements is intended to support project development, operational continuity, asset advancement, regulatory compliance, and ecosystem infrastructure. Allocation of proceeds is determined by internal governance processes and is not tied to short-term market conditions or token price performance.

No assurance is provided regarding timelines, outcomes, or financial returns. Project development is subject to operational, regulatory, market, and execution risks.

Secondary Market Independence

Secondary market trading of DIGau, where permitted by law, occurs independently of the Dignity Gold organization. The project does not operate trading platforms, provide liquidity guarantees, or engage in price support activities. Market prices are determined by independent participants and may be volatile.

Dignity Gold does not make representations regarding market value, liquidity, or future pricing of DIGau.

Regulatory Awareness

The project operates in a complex and evolving legal environment. Regulatory treatment of digital assets varies by jurisdiction and may change over time. Participants are responsible for understanding and complying with applicable laws, including securities, commodities, tax, and anti-money laundering regulations.

Conclusion

These offering and structural notes are provided solely for transparency and informational purposes. They are intended to assist stakeholders in understanding the project’s approach to funding and token structure without creating expectations of financial performance or investment opportunity.
