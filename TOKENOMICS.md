Dignity Gold Tokenomics Overview
Version 1.0

Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the tokenomics framework for DIGau, the primary digital asset within the Dignity Gold ecosystem. The purpose of this disclosure is to provide transparency regarding token supply, allocation categories, issuance discipline, and funding context. This document should be read in conjunction with the Dignity Gold Public Whitepaper and accompanying legal disclaimers.

Total Token Supply

The maximum total supply of DIGau is fixed at three billion tokens. No additional tokens beyond this maximum supply are intended to be created. Token supply parameters are designed to provide long-term predictability and to avoid inflationary dynamics that could undermine ecosystem stability.

Token Allocation Structure

The total DIGau supply is allocated across several defined categories reflecting historical participation, governance, ecosystem development, and future capital formation. Founder allocation represents a portion of the supply reserved for founding contributors and long-term project stewardship. Insider and investor allocations reflect participation by early supporters and strategic stakeholders.

A significant portion of the supply is allocated to legacy token holders associated with the project’s earlier phase. These tokens are subject to transfer restrictions and are not freely tradable on open markets. The company retains exclusive discretion with respect to any potential repurchase or retirement of these tokens, and they are not intended to contribute to circulating supply.

Additional allocations are designated for ecosystem monetization programs, strategic initiatives, and long-term development. These tokens are subject to lockups and controlled release mechanisms consistent with governance policies.

Unminted Supply

A portion of the maximum supply remains unminted. Of this unminted allocation, a majority has already been pledged for specific regulatory or jurisdictional purposes. The remaining unminted tokens are reserved for future private placements and capital formation initiatives. Any such issuance is subject to governance approval and compliance considerations.

Circulating Supply Considerations

Circulating supply represents tokens that are actively available for transfer and trading in the market. Circulating supply excludes restricted, locked, or otherwise non-transferable tokens. As a result, circulating supply may differ materially from total supply. The project emphasizes transparency in distinguishing between issued, circulating, and restricted tokens.

Funding Context

To date, the project has been supported by founder capital contributions and strategic investments. Future funding initiatives are expected to be conducted through limited private placements rather than public offerings. Proceeds from any such initiatives are intended to support operational development, asset advancement, and long-term ecosystem sustainability.

Valuation Perspective

Market capitalization metrics are subject to fluctuation based on circulating supply and market pricing. Fully diluted valuation reflects the maximum supply multiplied by prevailing market prices and should be interpreted accordingly. Independent third-party valuation work has been conducted for internal and governance purposes, but such valuations should not be interpreted as guarantees of market value.

Issuance Discipline

The Dignity Gold initiative adopts a conservative issuance philosophy. Token releases are structured to avoid supply shocks and to align with operational milestones and governance oversight. There is no automated emission schedule, yield program, or inflationary reward mechanism associated with DIGau.

Conclusion

The DIGau tokenomics framework is designed to support long-term participation, transparency, and responsible growth. By emphasizing supply discipline, restricted legacy allocations, and measured capital formation, the project seeks to align digital asset participation with sustainable real-world development rather than short-term speculative activity.
